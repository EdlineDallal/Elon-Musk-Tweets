# Elon Musk's Tweets 
While searching on Kaggle to practice new technique, this data caught my attention. 
I downloaded this dataset from kaggle to practice different datasets. This dataset includes tweets from Elon Musk in 2022. 
Working with this data allows me to learn, use and practice new tools such as the textblob package. 
While working on analysing the data, I exposed to one more subject in coding, I practiced how twitter api works, learned about sentiment, and how to score tweets, the devision on tweets to polarity and subjectivity and the meaning of each of them. 

## Overview
This project analyzes Elon Musk's tweets from 2022 to answer several questions related to tweet sentiment, tweet frequency, and the correlation between tweet sentiment and likes/retweets. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and consists of a CSV file that was cleaned and analyzed using various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn.

## Data Source
Elon Musk's Tweets Dataset 2022 was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marta99/elon-musks-tweets-dataset-2022. The dataset contains information about the total number of tweets, retweets, and likes, as well as the sentiment and subjectivity of each tweet.

## Analysis Questions
1) How many tweets are defined as Positive, Negative & Neutral sentiments?
2) In what months the tweets by Elon Musk are higher comparison to other months across the year?
3) In what day/days across the week the tweets by Elon Musk are higher?

## Summary 
The analysis revealed that most of Elon Musk's tweets are positive sentiment, and just 14% of total tweets are negative. There is a positive correlation between the sentiment of the tweet and the number of likes and retweets. More positive sentiment tweets are objective and fact-based with fewer opinions. Elon Musk tweets an average of 10.6 tweets per day and is most active on Fridays. The highest number of tweets and likes occurred in March, April, and May, likely due to the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk during that time.
