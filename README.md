# Elon-Musk-Tweets
I downloaded this dataset from kaggle to practice different datasets. This dataset includes tweets from Elon Musk in 2022. Working with this data allows me to learn, use and practice new tools such as the textblob package. 
While working on analysing the data, I exposed to one more subject in coding, I practiced how twitter api works, learned about sentiment, and how to score tweets, the devision on tweets to polarity and subjectivity and the meaning of each of them. 

My questions anaylsis of this study case were: 

1. How many tweets are defined as Positive, Negative & Neutral sentiments?
2. In what months the tweets by Elon musk are higher comparison to other months across the year?
3. In what day/days across the week the tweets by Elon musk are higher?

Feel free to contact me for clarifications
